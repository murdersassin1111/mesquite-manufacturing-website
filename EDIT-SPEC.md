## Real Services (exact from their site)
1. Precision CNC Machining — 4th axis, ±0.001"–0.005", metals/plastics/composites
2. Prototype Development — rapid prototyping, iterative feedback, cost-effective
3. Custom Assembly — integration, testing, tailored solutions
4. 3D Printing — additive manufacturing, diverse materials

## Real About Text
"At Mesquite Manufacturing, we are an innovative CNC manufacturing company dedicated to providing top-quality solutions for our clients. Our fourth axis solutions allow us to manufacture high volume parts at lower cost than our competitors."

## Key Differentiator
4th axis CNC = high-volume parts at lower cost than competitors

## Realistic Lead Times (MUST UPDATE)
- Prototype: 5-10 business days
- Standard production: 2-4 weeks  
- High-volume runs: 3-6 weeks
- Rush: Available with expedite fee (+15-25%)
- Quote turnaround: 24-48 hours

## Stats to FIX (remove fake numbers)
- Remove "12,000+ Parts Delivered" or change to modest "Thousands of parts delivered"
- Remove "340+ Active Clients"
- Remove "98.7% On-Time Rate"
- Remove "<2% Rejection Rate"
- Remove ISO 9001:2015 claim UNLESS actually certified
- Replace with honest trust signals: "Texas-Based", "24/7 Operations", "4th Axis CNC"

## Case Studies
- Remove all fake case studies OR replace with generic anonymized examples
- Better: replace with a "Recent Work" gallery showing real machined parts

## Industries (keep but make honest)
- Keep general industry list but don't claim specific certs you don't have
- Good: "We serve clients in aerospace, automotive, medical, and general manufacturing"
- Bad: "AS9100D certified" (unless true)

## Contact Info
- Must include real phone number (check if they have one)
